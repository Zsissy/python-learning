第二十章　高启强的挣扎
 Chapter 20 Gao Qiqiang's struggle
    小灵通专卖店已经结束营业，高氏兄弟在清理盘点。
PHS store has closed, gao brothers in cleaning up the inventory.
    高启强说了一句：“你说安欣和徐江谁能先找到那个司机？”
Gao Qiqiang said: " Who said An Xin and Xu Jiang can find the driver first?”
    “谁先找到都一样，徐江这次脱不了干系。”
"Whoever finds it first is the same, Xu Jiang can not get rid of the responsibility this time.”
    “是，都该了结了。”
"Yes, it's all over.”
    高启盛忽然严肃地看着高启强：“你是不是准备等警察抓了徐江就去自首？”
 Gao Qisheng suddenly looked at Gao Qiqiang seriously: " Are you ready to wait for the police to catch Xu Jiang to surrender?”
    高启强沉默着，但表情已经说明了一切。
Gao Qiqiang was silent, but the expression had said it all.
    高启盛生气地把手上的账本一摔：“我就知道！你说要给安欣送什么大礼，原来就是把自己送出去！”
Gao Qisheng angrily put on the hand of the account book a fell: " I know! What gift do you say to give Anxin, it is to send yourself out!”
    “小盛，这件事已经扯不清了，咱家搅和得越久就会陷得越深。我前前后后仔细想过了，只要我把这些事儿都扛下来，就不会牵连到你，也不会牵连到这家店。你还能好好地做生意……”
"Xiao Sheng, this matter is already unclear, the longer we disturb, the deeper we will sink. I've thought about it, and as long as I carry all these down, I won't involve you or the store. You can also do a good business with the......"
    “哥，你知道这几个月咱们赚了多少钱？毛利润十万，而且每个月都比上个月更多。好日子刚刚开始，你就不过了？”
"Brother, do you know how much money we have made in these months? Gross profit of $100, and more per month than last month. The good days are just beginning, but can't you pass it?”
    “你聪明又有见识，哥打心里高兴。生意做成了，哥也就能放心离开几年了。再说，徐江被抓，肯定得供出我来，早晚的事儿，我还不如争取个宽大处理。晚饭你自己吃吧，我去办点儿事。放心，不是去自首。徐江一天没被抓，我就一天不能被抓住，我得盯着他，防止他对你们做什么事儿。”说罢，高启强拉开卷帘门，自己钻了出去。
"You are smart and knowledgeable. I feel happy. When the business is done, I can leave for a few years. Besides, Xu Jiang was caught, must have to give me, sooner or later, I might as well strive for a lenient treatment. Eat dinner for yourself. I'll do something. Rest assured, not to turn yourself in. Xu Jiang is not caught a day, I can not be caught a day, I have to stare at him, to prevent him from doing anything to you."Said, Gao Qiqiang opened the shutter door and got out.
    高启盛焦躁地在店里来回踱着步子。终于，他想出了办法，拿起小灵通拨出一串号码。
 Gao Qisheng anxiously paced back and forth in the store. Finally, he came up with a way, picked up the PHS to dial out a string of number.
    入夜的西萍县公安局里，李队长陪着胳膊上绑着绷带的安欣走进门。
 At night, Xiping County Public Security Bureau, Captain Li accompanied the arm bandaged Anxin into the door.
    李响正好从审讯室出来。
Li Xiang happened to come out of the interrogation room.
    李队长招呼着李响：“正好，安欣的手术刚做完，麻药劲儿都没过就非要过来。交给你了。”
Captain Li greeted Li Xiang: " Just right, Anxin's operation has just finished, the anesthetic has not had to come over. It's for you.”
    李响看着安欣，说：“人都在呢，有什么不放心的？”
Li Xiang looked at An Xin and said, " People are there. What can you worry about?”
    安欣压低声音：“枪呢，我的枪呢？”
Ann lowered her voice. " What about the gun, my gun?”
    李响从贴身的兜里掏出来，枪还装在证物袋里。“给你保管好了，放心。”
Li Xiang took it out of his personal pocket, and the gun was still in the evidence bag."Take good care of it for you, and rest assured.”
    安欣用好的那只手接过来，揣进自己怀里。“审得怎么样？”
Anxin took it over with her good hand and put it into her arms."How is the review?”
    李响点头说道：“司机郭振交代得很快，承认自己收了徐江的钱，把老板出卖了。”
Li Xiang nodded and said, " The driver, Guo Zhen, explained very quickly and admitted that he had taken Xu Jiang's money and sold the boss.”
    安欣连忙问道：“他能做目击证人吗？”
Anxin hurriedly asked, " Can he be a witness?”
    李响摆了一个“OK”的手势：“没问题，徐江杀人的时候他也在，埋尸地点都招了。”
Li Xiang put a "OK" gesture: " No problem, Xu Jiang killed when he was also in, buried the body site are all recruit.”
    安欣欣喜若狂：“太好了！这下徐江完蛋了！赶紧把报告传回京海。”
An Xin was ecstatic: " Great! This time Xu Jiang is finished! Send the report back to Jinghai.”
    李响看看周围，把安欣拉到自己身边，小声说着：“动静搞得那么大，报告早就传回京海了，要不然你以为我敢决定就地审讯？两个局长已经猜出来你怀疑他们了，师父也跟着你挨了好一顿骂。”
Li Xiang looked around and pulled Anxin to her side, and whispered, " The movement is so great that the report would have been sent back to Jinghai. Otherwise, would you think I dare to decide to try on the spot? The two directors have guessed that you suspected them, and the master also followed you to get a good scolding.”
    安欣有些紧张：“那结果呢？”
Anxin was somewhat nervous: " What about the result?”
    李响笑笑：“安局在办公室等着呢，审讯结果传回去，他马上去申请徐江的逮捕令。”
Li Xiang smiled: " The security bureau is waiting in the office, the results of the trial passed back, he immediately went to apply for Xu Jiang's arrest warrant.”
    安欣高兴地说：“那还等什么？！赶快吧！”
 An Xin said happily, " What are you waiting for?! Hurry up!”
    西萍县公安局审讯室内，疯驴子耷拉着脑袋，完全没了之前的神气，却还是不配合。
Xiping County public Security Bureau interrogation room, the crazy donkey drooped his head, completely did not have before the air, but still do not cooperate.
    “郭振已经都交代了，你的老板都完蛋了，你还替他死撑着，有必要吗？”
"Guo Zhen has all explained, your boss is finished, you still support for him, is it necessary?”
    疯驴子一脸戏谑地看着安欣：“你怎么知道他完蛋了？”
The crazy donkey looked at Anxin with a playful face. " How do you know he is finished?”
    安欣掰着指头数：“杀人，郭振能证明；雇凶杀人，麻子能证明。”
An Xin counted on his fingers: " Kill, Guo Zhen can prove; hire a murder, pockmark can prove.”
    李响补充道：“还有从事和资助黑社会组织活动。这些罪过就不小了。”
Li Xiang added: " There are also engaged and funding triad activities. These SINS are not small.”
    安欣敲了敲桌子：“就差你的证词了，给他再加一条非法买卖器官。”
Anxin knocked on the table: " Just your testimony, give him another illegal trading organs.”
    疯驴子点头道：“行，我承认我栽了，但是你们凭这些就想抓老板，有点儿天真。公安是了不起，可是公安头上就没有紧箍咒吗？”
The crazy donkey nodded and said: " ok, I admit I fell, but you want to catch the boss with these, a little naive. Public security is great, but there is no constraint on the public security head?”
    安欣一愣：“你什么意思？”
An Xin a leng: " What do you mean?”
    疯驴子看着安欣笑了：“你说的那些罪名只能治治我们，但治不了徐江。就算抓了他，你也判不了，早晚还得放出来。”
The mad donkey looked at Anxin and smiled: " The charges you said can only cure us, but not Xu Jiang. Even if you catch him, you can't judge him, sooner or later you have to release him.”
    “你是说有人在保护他？”
"You mean someone is protecting him?”
    疯驴子一脸无奈与质疑：“警察叔叔，你们是第一天跟他打交道吗？这种事自己还不清楚？”
 Mad donkey a face helpless and question: " police uncle, you are the first day to deal with him? You don't know anything about that yet?”
    安欣和李响交换了一下眼神，都清楚疯驴子不是虚张声势。
An Xin and Li Xiang exchanged eyes, all clear that crazy donkey is not a bluff.
    安欣严肃地问：“谁在保护徐江？”
Anxin asked seriously, " Who is protecting Xu Jiang?”
    “这个，不知道。”
"This one, I don't know.”
    李响拍着桌子：“老实交代！”
Li Xiang patted the table: " honest account!”
    疯驴子一皱眉：“你们是白痴吗？这我能知道吗？换成是你，你，你们能显摆是谁保护的你们吗？我只是听说，那个大人物很喜欢手表。”
 The mad donkey frowned. " Are you idiots? Can I know that? If it was you, you, can you show off who protected you? I just heard that the big man loves watches.”
    深夜，街道上几乎已经看不见什么人。高启强喝了不少酒，踉踉跄跄地走在路上。
Late at night, there was almost no one in the street. Gao Qiqiang drank a lot of wine and staggered on the road.
    律师的话一直在他耳边回响：“按照您说的，这位朋友已经涉嫌较为严重的刑事犯罪，而且犯了好几条。一般来说，会数罪并罚。最少最少，也要十年。”
 The lawyer's words have always echoed in his ears: " As you say, this friend has been suspected of more serious criminal crimes, and has committed several. Generally speaking, there will be several crimes and punishment. At least, at least, in ten years.”
    高启强被地上的一块砖头绊倒，结结实实摔了个跟头。
 Gao tripped over a brick on the ground and fell on his head.
    他想爬却爬不起来，瘫在地上，捂着脸哀号。
He tried to climb but could not get up, and collapsed on the ground, covering his face and wailing.
    高启强喊道：“十年，老子一辈子能有几个十年？”
Gao Qiqiang shouted: " Ten years, how many years can I have in my lifetime?”
    一个瘦小的身影背着个大包，走到他跟前端详着：“哥？”
 A thin figure, with a big bag on his back, came up to him and looked at him: " Brother?”
    高启强揉揉眼睛，难以置信，是妹妹高启兰站在自己面前。
Gao Qiqiang rubbed his eyes, in disbelief, is his sister Gao Qilan standing in front of him.
    高启兰将哥哥扶起：“你怎么喝酒啦，还喝成这样？”
Gao Qilan helped his brother up: " How did you drink, still drink like this?”
    高启强一脸惊讶：“小兰，你怎么回来了？”
Gao Qiqiang looked surprised: " Xiao LAN, how did you come back?”
    高启兰说道：“二哥给我打了电话，说家里有大事，让我马上回来一趟。”
 Gao qilan said, " My second brother called me and said there was a big deal in my family and asked me to come back immediately.”
    “这浑小子……”高启强挣扎着想爬起来，手脚却不听使唤。
"This boy..." Gao Qiqiang struggled to get up, hands and feet do not listen.
    高启兰费了半天的劲儿才把哥哥撑起来。兄妹俩相互搀扶着，向家走去。
 Gao Qilan took me a long time to put his brother up. The two brother and sister helped each other and walked home.
    深夜，市公安局局长办公室内再一次灯火通明起来。
Late at night, the city public security bureau director's office was once again brightly lit up.
    曹闯披着衣服，坐在行军床上接电话。“嗯，我听明白了。疯驴子说的情况应该是真实的。自从我们开始调查白金瀚，就一直受到来自上面的压力，连派去盯梢的人都撤掉了。徐江跟很多市级领导的关系不错，但是谁是他的保护伞，一时还摸不清楚。”
Cao Chuang was dressed and sat on the camp bed to answer the phone."Well, I get it. What the Crazy Donkey said should be true. Since we began investigating Platinum Han, we have been under pressure from the above, even the people sent to the watch are removed. Xu Jiang has a good relationship with many municipal leaders, but it is not clear who is his umbrella.”
    孟德海在一旁听得心焦，忍不住抢过手机：“安欣，我是孟德海！我告诉你，你别担心这些有的没的，徐江犯的是杀人案！你要做的就是把证据夯实。只要人证、物证齐全，逻辑链条清晰，谁都保不住他！”
Meng Dehai in a audit, could not help but grab the phone: " Anxin, I am Meng Dehai! I tell you, you don't worry about some of these, Xu Jiang is a murder! All you have to do is consolidate the evidence. As long as the witness, material evidence is complete, the logical chain is clear, who can not protect him!”
    这时，安欣的声音缓缓传了出来：“我不敢瞒着您，是这个线索不可靠，我想等有了结果再跟您汇报。”
At this time, Anxin's voice slowly came out: " I dare not hide from you, is this clue is not reliable, I want to wait to report to you after the result.”
    孟德海喊道：“别学那套弯弯绕，你道行差得远，怎么听都假。我告诉你，你安叔正在准备材料，申请徐江的逮捕令，我们几个老家伙，做事考虑的是大局，不可能像你们一样意气用事。不过你放心，这件事目前只有咱们五个人知道，要是真的走漏了消息，就从咱五个人里查。”
Meng Dehai shouted: " Don't learn that set of winding, you go far away, how to listen to all false. I tell you, your uncle An is preparing materials to apply for Xu Jiang's arrest warrant. We old guys consider the overall situation, and it is impossible to be as ambitious as you. But don't worry, only five of us know about this. If we really miss the news, check the five of us.”
    “孟局，你就别故意损我了。”
"Meng bureau, you don't deliberately hurt me.”
    听着安欣说话，孟德海笑了，“好好养伤，安全回来。”
 Listening to Anxin, Meng Dehai smiled, " Get well and come back safely.”
    “是！”安欣干净利索地答道。
"yes!"Anxin replied cleanly.
    高启强回到家中，气急败坏地把高启盛从屋里拽到楼下。
Gao Qiqiang returned home and angrily pulled Gao Qisheng from the house to the downstairs.
    高启强压低声音道：“你给小兰打电话说什么了？”
Gao qiqiang lowered his voice: " What did you call Xiao LAN about?”
    高启盛扶了一下眼镜：“叫她回来团聚一下，不然下次再见你，只能在监狱里了。”
 Gao Qisheng helped the glasses: " ask her to come back for a reunion, or see you next time, can only be in prison.”
    高启强虽然压低了声音，但还是听得出来满腔愤怒。
Although Gao Qiqiang lowered his voice, but still heard the voice full of anger.
    “是我想去坐牢吗？还不是为了你们能过上安生日子？小兰跟这事儿一点儿关系都没有，我是我，她是她，她不该受我的连累，你把她搅和进来干什么？”
"Do I want to go to prison? Is it not for you can live a good life? Xiaolan has nothing to do with this matter. I am me, she is her, and she shouldn't be affected by me. Why do you mix her in?”
    高启盛点头道：“对，她可以不受你的连累，她可以去一个陌生的城市生活，断绝关系，过自己的人生。但是你问问她，她愿意吗？你还记得过年那天吗？你被抓去公安局，小兰哭着不肯回家，一直在外面等你到半夜。你觉得她会扔下你自己去过好日子吗？”
Gao Qisheng nodded: " Yes, she can not be you, she can go to a strange city, break off relations and live her own life. But if you ask her, will she be willing to do? Do you still remember the day of the Chinese New Year holiday? You were arrested to the public security bureau, Xiaolan cried and refused to go home, has been waiting for you until midnight. Do you think she'll leave you alone to live a good life?”
    高启兰不安地从家里出来，扶着楼梯上的围栏，大喊：“哥，你们干吗呢？到底出什么事儿了？快回来吧！”
Gao Qilan came out of her house anxiously, holding up the fence on the stairs and Shouting, " Brother, what are you doing? What's wrong? Come back!”
    高启强和高启盛同时抬起头，高启强笑着说：“能有什么事儿？还不是你二哥捣乱？我们买了夜宵就回来。”
Gao Qiqiang and Gao Qisheng looked up at the same time and said with a smile, " What can happen? Isn't your second brother making trouble? We bought the supper and came back.”
    高启兰笑着喊道：“我就想吃你做的汤面。”
 Gao qilan smiled and shouted, " I just want to eat your soup noodles.”
    厨房里的高启强往锅里倒水，点上火，然后盯着蓝色的火苗发呆。
In the kitchen, Gao Qiqiang poured water into the pot, lit the fire, and then stared at the blue flames.
    外屋传来兄妹俩的嬉闹声：“啊……大哥……二哥抢我电视！你快来揍他！”
 From the outroom came the brother and sister: " Ah... eldest brother... second brother robbed my TV! Come and beat him!”
    高启强哭了——这是他最舍不得的，家里的烟火气。
 Gao Qiqiang cried —— this is his most reluctant, the fireworks of the home.
    兄妹三人围在桌前吃热汤面。
 Brother and sister gathered around the table to eat hot soup noodles.
    高启兰努力做出一副愉快的样子。兄弟俩都心事重重。
Gao Qilan tried to make a happy look. Both the brothers were preoccupied.
    高启兰正色道：“吃饱了，哥，现在能说了吧，到底叫我回来是因为什么事儿？”
Gao Qilan is color way: " eat full, elder brother, now can say, in the end call me to come back because of what thing?”
    高启强斟酌着词句道：“小兰，我本来想换个地方生活，可能会离开你们一段时间，但是想了又想，还是舍不得，所以不走了。”
Gao Qiqiang considered his words: " Xiao LAN, I wanted to live in another place. I might leave you for a while, but after I think, I still can't give up, so I don't leave.”
    高启盛开心道：“就这？你早说，我就不把小兰叫回来了。”
Gao Qi blooming heart way: " be on this? You have said that, I won't have called Xiaolan back.”
    高启强瞪着眼睛：“你还不满意？回头再跟你算账。”
 Gao Ziqiang stared: " Are you not satisfied? Go back to you.”
    兄弟俩闹了一阵，发现小兰没有动静，扭头一看，吓了一跳。
The two brothers make for a while, found that Xiaolan did not move, turned a look, startled.
    高启兰瘪着嘴，眼泪哗哗往下淌。“哥，你不要我们了。”
Gao qilan's mouth was flat, tears streaming down."Brother, you don't want us anymore.”
    高启强慌了，连忙安慰道：“不走了不走了，都说了不走了。”
Gao Qiqiang panicked, hurriedly comfort way: " do not go do not go, all said not to go.”
    高启兰放声大哭：“吓死我了，我以为你不要我们了。”
 Gao Qilan cried aloud, " I was scared to death. I thought you didn't want us anymore.”
    高启强一边手忙脚乱地安慰妹妹，一边抽打高启盛。
 Gao Qiqiang scrambled to comfort his sister, while beating Gao Qisheng.
    高启盛躲着巴掌，还不忘笑话高启兰。
 Gao Qisheng hid in his hand, but also did not forget to laugh at Gao Qilan.
    清晨，西萍县公安局，警察押着疯驴子、麻子、郭振三人出门，上了警车。审讯结果已经传回了京海，此刻安长林正在去往检察院的路上，申请徐江的逮捕令。
Early in the morning, Xiping County Public Security Bureau, the police escorted crazy donkey, pockmarked, Guo Zhen three people out, on the police car. The result of the trial has been returned to Jinghai, and now An Changlin is on his way to the procuratorate, applying for Xu Jiang's arrest warrant.
    李响扶着安欣，跟李队长和政委握手告别：“还要麻烦你们出人押送，真是不好意思。”
 Li Xiang helped An Xin and shook hands with Captain Li and the political commissar. " I am really sorry to escort you out again.”
    这时，装证据的盒子里突然响起手机铃声。
At this moment, the cell phone suddenly rang in the evidence box.
    李响翻出一个证物袋，说：“是疯驴子的手机。”
 Li Xiang turned out an evidence bag and said, " It's a crazy donkey's mobile phone.”
    手机不停地响，仿佛只要不接，对方就会一直打过来。
 The phone keeps ringing, as if if you don't answer, the other side will keep coming.
    安欣按下免提，接通电话。
 Anxin pressed the hands-free phone and connected to the phone.
    没人说话，只有沉重的呼吸声。漫长的几十秒后，电话突兀地挂断了。
No one spoke, only a heavy sound of breathing. After a few long seconds, the phone hung up abruptly.
    李响忙道：“我给电信局打电话，叫他们查一下来电号码。”
Li Xiang busy way: " I call the telecommunication bureau, ask them to check the call number.”
    安欣摇头：“来不及了，给孟局打电话，立刻、马上行动！”
 An Xin shook his head: " It is too late, call the Meng bureau, immediately, immediately action!”
    一队警车呼啸着，堵住小区的道路。
 A group of police cars roared, blocking the road in the neighborhood.
    警察们全体下车，由曹闯带头，冲向徐家。
 The police all got off, led by Cao Chuang, and rushed to the Xu family.
    几个打手拦在门前。
Several thugs stopped them in front of the door.
    曹闯怒目圆睁：“滚！”
 Cao Chuang angry eyes round open: " Roll!”
    老六和手下人吓了一跳，嚣张气焰顿时不见了，乖乖地让开。
Old six and his men were startled, the arrogance immediately disappeared, obediently let out of the way.
    曹闯伸手砸门，毫不客气。“市局刑警队，开门！”
 Cao Chuang reached out and hit the door and left it unceremoniously."City bureau criminal police team, open the door!”
    房间里没人应声。
No one answered in the room.
    张彪跑过来说：“徐江的车还在，应该没跑。”
Zhang Biao ran over and said, " Xu Jiang's car is still there, I should not run.”
    曹闯稍稍放下点儿心。“你接着敲！”
 Cao Chuang was relieved a little bit."Then you knock!”
    张彪继续敲门。
 Zhang Biao kept knocking on the door.
    曹闯沿墙找到一处开着的窗户，探头向里面张望。
 Cao Chuang found an open window along the wall and peered inside.
    沙发上似乎有个人，正盖着毯子睡觉。
 There seemed to be a man on the sofa, sleeping under a blanket.
    手机忽然震动起来，曹闯接通。
 The mobile phone suddenly shook up, Cao Chuang connected.
    “逮捕令已经拿到了，不用等我，立即抓人，出了问题我负责。”安长林隔着电话命令道。
"The warrant is already available. Don't wait for me. Catch someone immediately. I'm responsible for the problem."An Chang Lin ordered him through the phone.
    房门被撞开，曹闯带头冲进去。“徐江，你被捕了！”
 The door was smashed open, and Cao Chuang took the lead and rushed in."Xu Jiang, you were arrested!”
    他快步走到沙发前，掀开毯子。
 He walked quickly up to the sofa and lifted back the blanket.
    沙发上只有几个抱枕。
There are only a few throw pillows on the sofa.

第二十二章　表彰大会
 Chapter 22 The Commendation Conference
    市政府副市长办公室里，赵立冬签完字，放下笔，伸了个懒腰。他对自己先前的工作非常满意。安欣这个小警察现在算是被架在火上烤，所有人的奖金因为他丢失枪支和擅自行动而取消，安欣却作为个人英雄要接受隆重表彰。这一挑拨群众斗群众的招数是赵立冬的基本操作，但屡试屡爽。赵立冬起身，从书架上取出一本《资治通鉴》。书中挖空、缺失的部分躺着一块卡地亚钻表。赵立冬戴好钻表，满意地端详着。他刚答应了成为丧家之犬的徐江在表彰大会时送他离开京海，那个时候路上的警察最少，但是究竟送徐江去哪里，他还需要好好想想……
 In the office of the deputy mayor of the municipal government, Zhao Lidong signed, put down his pen and stretched himself. He was very pleased with his previous work. Anxin, a small policeman, is now baked on a fire, and all his bonus is cancelled because he lost his gun and acted arbitrarily, but Anxin is honored as a personal hero. This one provoke the masses to fight the masses is the basic operation of Zhao Lidong, but repeatedly tried. Zhao Lidong got up and took out a book of "History As A Mirror" from the bookshelf. The hollowed-out, missing part of the book lies on a Cartier drill table. Zhao Lidong wears a good drill watch, looking at it with satisfaction. He just agreed to become the bereaved dog, Xu Jiang sent him out of the Jinghai at the commendation meeting. At that time, the police on the road were the least, but he still needed to think about where he wanted to send Xu Jiang?
    深夜，一个不知名的公用电话亭里，徐江冻得哆哆嗦嗦，拨通电话。
Late at night, in an unknown public telephone booth, Xu Jiang was shivering with cold and dialed the phone.
    “泰叔，是我。咱们认识多少年了？”
"Uncle Tai, it is me. How many years have we known each other?”
    电话里沉默了一会儿，传出声音：“快三十年了。”
The phone was silent for a while, and the voice said: " Nearly 30 years.”
    徐江沉声道：“我拿三十年的交情求您办一件事，行不行？”
Xu Jiang sank: " I take thirty years of friendship to do a matter, ok?”
    “你说，但我不一定答应。”
"You say, but I may not agree.”
    “我知道郭振的地址是您交给高家兄弟的。我说这个没别的意思，就想让您想个说辞，把他们骗出来，让我跟他们做个了结。”
"I know Guo Zhen's address was given by you to the Gao family brothers. I meant nothing else, so I want you to make a statement, fool them out, and let me make an end with them.”
    电话里的泰叔叹口气：“徐江，你知道我没有孩子，是个老绝户。一直以来，我都是把你当儿子看待的，是你看不上我这老头子，伤了我的心。我跟姓高的没有交情，这个忙我可以帮。但是骗他们出来之后，你们就各凭本事吧！”
Uncle Tai on the phone sighed: " Xu Jiang, you know I have no children, is an old family. All the time, I treat you as a son, is you despise me this old man, hurt my heart. I have no friendship with the surname Gao, which I can help. But after cheating them out, you each skill!”
    徐江犹豫了一下，沉声道：“礼拜五上午十点，还在老钢铁厂。”
 Xu Jiang hesitated for a moment, sank: " Friday morning ten, still in the old steel factory.”
    市礼堂主席台的桌子上摆着一溜名牌，都是市委领导的名字。台上挂着“表彰大会”的横幅。台下的座位上同样贴着名牌，这些座位都属于市局、分局的大领导，孟德海、安长林赫然在列。后排已经基本坐满了，大家都身着笔挺的警服。前三排的领导还在陆续入场。
 On the table on the rostrum of the city auditorium is a string of famous brands, all the names of the municipal party committee leaders. Banners of the words "commendation conference" are hung on the stage. The seat under the stage also pasted the famous brand, these seats belong to the big leadership of the city bureau, Meng Dehai, An Changlin in the list. The back row was almost full, and everyone was dressed in straight police uniforms. The leaders of the first three rows are still coming in.
    安欣也换上了警服，站在侧幕后面，兴奋地向台下张望。
Anxin also changed into her police uniform, stood behind the side curtain, looking excitedly at the stage.
    李响兴冲冲地跑来，拍拍他：“你找我？”
Li Xiang ran excitedly and patted him: " Are you looking for me?”
    安欣指指台下：“今天来的人不少。”
Anxin pointed to the audience: " A lot of people came today.”
    “这次动静搞得挺大，除了市级几个单位，还通知了下面区县，好多单位都派了代表。”
"This movement is quite big, in addition to a few units at the municipal level, but also informed the following districts and counties, many units have sent representatives.”
    安欣摇摇头：“你觉得，赵立冬为什么要搞这么一场表彰大会？”
An Xin shook his head: " Do you think, why should Zhao Lidong hold such a commendation conference?”
    李响试探着问道：“给你找不痛快？”
Li Xiang tentatively asked: " to you find not happy?”
    “他未必把我放在眼里，只不过当个借口，掩护他去解决真正的麻烦。”
"He may not mind me, but as an excuse to cover him for the real trouble.”
    李响恍然道：“徐江？”
Li Xiang suddenly said: " Xu Jiang?”
    安欣连忙问：“‘2.1’专案组的人都来了吗？”
 An Xin hurriedly asked: " Have all the 2.1 task force come?”
    李响点头。
Li Xiang nodded.
    安欣继续说道：“也就是说，之前给徐江通风报信的人就在这些人里。”
Anxin continued: " That is to say, the people who had informed Xu Jiang were among them.”
    李响看着安欣，问：“你是说，赵立冬会趁着今天派这个人送徐江出城？”
Li Xiang looked at An Xin and asked, " You mean, Zhao Lidong will send this man to send Xudong Jiang out of the city today?”
    安欣犹豫着说道：“不确定，也许是出城，也许是灭口。总之今天提前离开会场的人很可能就是内鬼。”
 Anxin hesitated and said: " Not sure, maybe it is out of the city, maybe it is silence. Anyway, the people who left the venue early today are likely to be insiders.”
    小灵通专卖店里，高启强接听着泰叔的电话。
PHS store, Gao Qiqiang answered the phone of the Thai uncle.
    “小高，你现在有没有空？陈书婷有件东西让我转交给你们兄弟。”
"Xiao Gao, do you have any time right now? Chen Shuting has something I to transfer to your brothers.”
    高启强看了一眼忙碌的弟弟：“好，我现在过来。”
Gao Ziqiang took a look at his busy brother. " Well, I'm here now.”
    泰叔接着说：“十点钟，老钢铁厂，叫上你弟弟。”
 Uncle Tai then said: " At ten o'clock, the old steel factory, call your brother.”
    高启强一怔，对面已经挂了电话。
 Gao Qiqiang a zheng, the opposite has hung up the phone.
    “哥，有事？”高启盛走过来问道。
"Brother, what?"Asked Gao Qisheng, coming over.
    高启强犹豫了一下，说：“小事，我出去一趟，中午就回来，等我一块儿吃饭。”说完匆匆离开了店铺。
 Gao Qiqiang hesitated and said: " Small things, I go out, come back at noon, wait for me to eat together."He hurried from the shop.
    高启盛看着高启强的背影，微微皱起了眉头。
 Gao Qisheng looked at Gao Qiqiang's back, frowning slightly frowning.
    市委大院的礼堂外，李响坐在一辆出租车上，紧盯着马路对面市委大院的门口。这时，一辆警车从院里开了出来。
Outside the auditorium of the municipal party committee compound, Li Xiang sat in a taxi, staring at the entrance of the municipal party committee compound across the road. Then a police car came out of the yard.
    李响拍拍司机：“师父，跟上前面那辆警车，别跟太紧。”
 Li Xiang patted the driver: " Master, follow the police car in front of you, don't follow too tight.”
    司机一脚油门跟上。
The driver put his foot on the accelerator.
    李响握着手机，压低声音对电话那边的安欣说：“你的判断可能是对的，我正在跟踪咱局的一辆警车，它离开礼堂之后没有回市局，现在正往城郊开。”
 Holding his mobile phone, Li Xiang said to Anxin, " Your judgment may be right. I am following a police car in our bureau, which left the auditorium without returning to the city bureau, and is now driving to the outskirts of the city.”
    此时的市礼堂里，赵立冬在台上侃侃而谈。
At this time in the city auditorium, Zhao Lidong talked on the stage.
    “京海安定的发展环境离不开一线干警的努力和付出……”
"The stable development environment of Jinghai cannot be separated from the efforts of frontline police and......"
    侧台，安欣捂住话筒，小声说话：“能不能看到车里的人？”
On the side stage, Anxin covered the microphone and whispered, " Can you see the people in the car?”
    李响的声音传入耳中：“看不到。你那边呢，能不能看出谁不在座位上？”
 Li Xiang's voice was heard: " I can't see it. What about you? Can you see who's not in the seat?”
    安欣向台下看去，全场黑压压的，几乎座无虚席。但前排领导座位却空着两个，椅背上贴着的姓名分别是孟德海、安长林。
An Xin looked to the audience, the audience was black, almost full. But the front row leader seat is empty two, the names on the back of the chair are Meng Dehai, An Changlin.
    安欣有些犹豫地说道：“暂时看不出什么，保持联系吧。”
"I can't see anything for the time being. Keep in touch.”
    高启强缓缓走进废钢铁厂，四下里荒草丛生，都是断壁残垣。他环顾四周，然后喊着：“泰叔、泰叔，我来啦！”
Gao Qiqiang slowly into the scrap steel plant, four under the grass, are broken walls. He looked around and shouted, " Uncle Tai, Uncle Tai, I have come!”
    徐江从一处断墙后绕出来。“泰叔不在，只有你爷爷我。”
Xu Jiang came out from behind a broken wall."Uncle Tai is not here, only your grandfather and me.”
    高启强吃了一惊，但很快冷静下来。“是你约我来的？”
Gao qiqiang was surprised, but soon calmed down."You asked me here?”
    徐江歪头看着高启强：“京海待不下去了，临走之前，咱俩还有恩怨要解决。”
Xu Jiang tilted his head and looked at Gao Qiqiang: " Jinghai can't stay anymore. Before leaving, we still have a grudge to solve.”
    “到处都是你的通缉令，你能走哪去？”
"Your wanted warrants are everywhere. Where can you go?”
    徐江笑道：“那就不劳你费心了，我有的是办法。在京海这么多年，花钱养肥了那么多人，不就是在这时候用的？”
Xu Jiang smiled and said, " Then don't bother you, I have plenty of ways. In Jinghai so many years, spend money to raise so many people, is not at this time to use?”
    “你就不怕他们杀你灭口？”
"You're not afraid of them killing you out?”
    “你还是担心自己吧。”
"You should worry about yourself.”
    高启强摇摇头：“咱俩一对一，你未必是我的对手，有什么好担心的？”
Gao Qiqiang shook his head: " we two one on one, you are not necessarily my opponent, what good to worry about?”
    徐江掏出被锯短的五连发自制枪：“现在呢？”
 Xu Jiang took out a five-shot homemade gun: " Now?”
    警车开下公路，穿过荒草，来到废钢铁厂的一处断墙外。
 The police car drove off the road and across the weeds to a broken wall in the scrap steel mill.
    出租车远远地停在公路边，避免被警车里的人发现。李响在出租车里紧盯着警车。
 The taxi stopped far on the side of the road to avoid being caught by people in the police car. Li Xiang was staring at the police car in the taxi.
    车门开了，一个穿着警服的人影下了车。
 The door opened, and a figure in a police uniform got out.
    李响的眼睛瞬间瞪大，呼吸急促，不敢相信自己看到的……
 Li Xiang's eyes were wide and he was breathing. He couldn't believe what he saw...
    市礼堂内，安欣依然站在侧幕条后面向下仔细地张望，安长林弓着身子走向自己的座位。
 Inside the city auditorium, Anxin still stood behind the side curtain and looked down carefully, as An Changlin hunched over to his seat.
    安欣长出了一口气，随后把目光落在了孟德海的位置上。
 An Xin extended a sigh of relief, and then put his eyes on the position of Meng Dehai.
    赵立冬仍在侃侃而谈。而内鬼的答案似乎已经有了。
Zhao Lidong is still talking freely. The mole's answer seems to be there already.
    安欣拨通电话：“喂，你看清是谁了吗？”
Anxin dialed: " Hello, do you see who it is?”
    半晌，李响才说话，声音有气无力：“对不起，我跟丢了。”
After a while, Li Xiang spoke, his voice was weak: " SORRY, I lost it.”
    安欣急忙说道：“怎么可能？你是不是瞒着我……是不是孟局？你说啊！”
 Anxin said quickly, " How is it possible? Are you hiding it from me... Meng Bureau? You say ah!”
    李响没有回应，挂断了电话。
Li Xiang did not respond and hung up the phone.
    赵立冬稍缓了一下语气，兴奋地说道：“下面，有请这次表彰大会的主角，京海市公安局刑警支队安欣，上台领奖！”
 Zhao Lidong slightly slowed down the tone, excitedly said: " Next, please welcome the protagonist of the commendation conference, Jinghai City Public Security Bureau Interpol detachment An Xin, on stage to receive the award!”
    台下掌声响起。
 The audience burst into applause.
    安欣慌张地把手机放进胸口，走上台。
 Anxin hurriedly put the phone in her chest and walked on the stage.
    头顶的灯光太亮了，刺激得安欣有些眼花。
 The overhead light was so bright that she was somewhat dazzled.
    台下的前辈、同事还在热烈地鼓掌。
 The audience of predecessors, colleagues are still warmly applauded.
    安欣努力眯起眼睛也看不清下面的面孔。
 Anxin tried to narrow her eyes and not see the faces below.
    孟德海的位置仍然空着。
 Mendehai remains empty.
    安欣眯着眼睛，看到一位穿着警服的长者慢慢走到他面前——孟德海。
Ann narrowed her eyes and saw an elder in police uniform slowly walked to him —— Meng Dehai.
    安欣一脸惊讶地说道：“孟局？”
An Xin said in surprise: " Meng Bureau?”
    孟德海手捧奖状，笑道：“怎么，我不能给你颁奖？”
 Meng Dehai holds the certificate in his hand and smiles: " Why, I can't give you the award?”
    安欣连忙说：“之前说负责颁奖的是曹队……”安欣瞪大了眼睛。
Anxin hurriedly said: "before said that the award is the Cao team..." Anxin stared big eyes.
    孟德海笑笑说：“他家里有事，先回去了。”
 Meng Dehai smiled and said: " He has something at home, so he went home first.”
    安欣的脑子“嗡”的一声，似乎炸开了。而这一瞬间，他也似乎明白了，李响为什么要说自己跟丢了。
 An Xin's brain "hum" a sound, it seems to burst open. And this moment, he also seems to understand, Li Xiang why to say he with lost.
    徐江和高启强正在废弃工厂里对峙，徐江忽然抬起枪口，神色轻松地望着远处。
Xu Jiang and Gao Qiqiang were facing off in the abandoned factory when Xu Jiang suddenly raised his gun and looked easily at the distance.
    “来得正好，替我杀了他。”
"It came in the right place and killed him for me.”
    高启强将信将疑地回头瞟了一眼，看见曹闯拎着枪，杀气腾腾地大步走过来，见到眼前的场面，愣住了。
Gao Qiqiang looked back suspiciously and saw Cao Chuang carrying a gun. Seeing the scene, he was stunned.
    高启强眯着眼看着曹闯：“就是你给徐江通风报的信？”
 Gao Qiqiang squinted at Cao Chuang: " Are you informing Xu Jiang?”
    曹闯像是被戳到痛处，立即把枪对准高启强。
Cao Chuang seemed to be poked to the sore place and immediately pointed his gun at Gao Qiqiang.
    徐江说道：“没错，就是他，赵副市长介绍的。曹队，赶紧杀了他，不然怎么跟领导交代？”
Xu Jiang said, " Yes, he, Vice Mayor Zhao. Cao team, quickly killed him, otherwise how to explain to the leader?”
    曹闯冲徐江怒喝道：“你闭嘴！”
Cao Chuang shouted Xu Jiang angrily, " You shut up!”
    高启强瞬间明了。“曹队长，你不是来杀我的，你是来解决徐江的吧？他是你们所有人的麻烦，杀了他，才能向上面交代，没错吧？”
 Gao Qiqiang instantly clear."Captain Cao, you are not here to kill me, are you here to solve Xu Jiang? He's for all of you. If you kill him, you can tell him, right?”
    徐江也意识到了曹闯的不对劲儿，枪口不知该指向高启强还是曹闯。
 Xu Jiang also realized that Cao Chuang was wrong, I do not know whether the gun pointed to Gao Qiqiang or Cao Chuang.
    曹闯的脸上杀意渐浓，他意识到两个人都要除掉。
 Cao Chuang's face became stronger, and he realized that both men had to get rid of them.
    三个人对峙着。
 Three men faced each other.
    在市礼堂的安欣手捧奖状，呆呆地站着。
 In the city auditorium, Anxin stood idly holding the award in her hand.
    赵立冬笑着让安欣说几句感言。
 Zhao Lidong smiled and let An Xin say a few words of speech.
    安欣走到麦克风前，大脑一片混乱。他把手伸进怀里，按下了李响的号码。
 Anxin went to the microphone, her brain was in turmoil. He reached into his arms and pressed Li Xiang's number.
    李响失魂落魄地沿着公路往回走，他的手机一直在响。
 Li Xiang walked back along the road, his mobile phone kept ringing.
    他拿起手机，显示来电是安欣。
 He picked up his cell phone and showed that the call was Anxin.
    他犹豫着，终于按下了接听，里面传来安欣的声音，既像是说给他的，也像是说给所有人的。
He hesitated, finally pressed the answer, inside came the voice of Anxin, both like to say to him, but also like to say to everyone.
    安欣对着麦克风缓缓地说道：“我想说的是——选择。人的一生中总会面临无数选择，这些选择会决定我们以后的道路。有人问我，为救一个嫌疑人而受伤，傻不傻？我认为，在我伸手拉住他的时候，其实是给了他再一次选择人生的机会。他可以选择改正错误，重新做一个好人。那么，我的付出就是值得的。我们这一生，可能会犯很多错误，但总有重新选择的权利。关键是，要在他彻底堕落之前，伸手拉住他！”
 Anxin said slowly to the microphone, " What I want to say is the —— choice. There are always countless choices in our life, and these choices will determine our future path. Someone asked me, to save a suspect and injured, silly is not silly? I think when I reached for him, it gave him a chance to choose life again. He can choose to correct his mistakes and be a good man again. Then, my pay is worth it. We may make a lot of mistakes in our life, but we always have the right to choose again. The point is to reach out to hold him before he completely falls!”
    台下静了片刻，响起掌声。
 The audience was quiet for a moment, and applause.
    安欣盯着自己的胸口，仿佛能听到自己的心跳和李响的喘息。
 Anxin stared at her chest, as if she could hear her heart beat and Li Xiang's breathing.
    终于，胸口传来李响的声音。安欣把胸口凑近麦克风，让在场所有人都能听到。
Finally, the voice of Li Xiang came from his chest. Anxin put her chest close to the microphone so that everyone could hear it.
    “302国道李庄路段，老钢铁厂内，发现嫌疑人。”
"302 National Road Li Zhuang section, in the old steel factory, found the suspect.”
    台下的人惊呆了。台上的赵立冬和孟德海也惊呆了。
The audience was stunned. The Zhao Lidong and Meng Dehai on the stage were also stunned.
    安欣一脸严肃，转身向孟德海郑重敬礼：“报告，‘2.1’专案组发现重要线索，请求立即出警！”
 An Xin a serious face, turned to Meng Dehai solemnly salute: " report, '2.1' task force found important clues, request immediately out to the police!”
    孟德海恍然大悟，明白了安欣前面那番话是说给谁听的，一把抢过麦克风。
Meng Dehai suddenly understood, understand the front of the words are said to who, a grabbed the microphone.
    “‘2.1’专案组所有成员，听我指挥，立刻出发！”
"All the members of the '2.1' task force, listen to my command, and set out immediately!”
    赵立冬坐在后面，脸色煞白。
Zhao Lidong sat behind, his face was white.

第二章　心结
 Chapter two knot
    两个月前，公安局的野外靶场上，刑警队站成一排，正在进行手枪射击训练，枪声此起彼伏。
 Two months ago, on the public security bureau's field range, the criminal police team stood in a row, is undergoing pistol shooting training, gunfire one after another.
    李响动作标准，眼神坚定。
 Li Xiang standard movement, firm eyes.
    安欣沉着脸，拿着自己的靶纸往外走。
With a calm face, Anxin walked out with her own target paper.
    张彪抢过来，说：“都在肩膀上，菩萨心肠啊!再过两个礼拜就是全省公安系统比武大赛了，你这成绩可别给局里拖后腿啊！”
 Zhang Biao grabbed over and said: " All on the shoulder, heart of Bodhisattva! Another two weeks is the whole province public security system competition, you this result don't give the bureau back leg!”
    安欣压着火，一把把靶纸抢过来，低着头走了。
 Anxin pressed the fire, grabbed the target paper, and walked away with his head down.
    李响想制止，望着安欣的背影，又把话咽了回去。
 Li Xiang wanted to stop, looked at Anxin's back, and swallowed the words back.
    右肩臂窝的伤势让安欣作为一名警察却打不准枪，所有人都知道，伤早就好了，一直好不了的是安欣。安欣一直在推演徐江死亡的现场，六年来，同一份报告交了改，改了交，可是无论改多少遍，结果都是一样的。
 The injury of the right shoulder arm socket makes Anxin, as a police officer, is not allowed to shoot. Everyone knows that the injury has long been fine, but Anxin has been fine. An Xin has been explaining the scene of Xu Jiang's death. For six years, the same report was handed in and changed, but no matter how many times it was changed, the result is the same.
    原先的白金瀚添置了新的灯光和陈设，相比过去的土豪气显得更加时尚气派。
 The original platinum han added new lights and furnishings, compared to the past tuhao gas appears more fashionable style.
    悍马车大咧咧地停在门口，唐小虎跳出来，从后座拖出大花篮，乐呵呵地走进白金瀚。
 The Hummer greatly stopped at the door, Tang Xiaohu jumped out, pulled out a big flower basket from the back seat, happily into the platinum Han.
    最大的一间包房里，唐小虎把花篮往高启强、高启盛兄弟俩面前一放。
In the largest room, Tang Xiaohu put the flower basket in front of Gao Qiqiang and Gao Qisheng.
    “小盛哥，生日快乐，生意兴隆，双喜临门！”
"Xiao Sheng, happy birthday, business is thriving, double happiness!”
    高启盛春风满面：“同喜同喜！自家人，还送什么东西？”
Gao Qisheng spring breeze face: " with xi with xi! What else do you family?”
    “那必须的，今天你的小灵通连锁超市开业，以后京海就是你一家的了！”
"That must, today your small PHS supermarket chain opened, after the Jinghai is your family!”
    高启盛笑着说了一句：“瞎说什么。”
Gao Qisheng said with a smile: " What nonsense.”
    高启强起身拉着唐小虎来到角落里的吧台处低声道：“你哥哥怎么样？”
Gao Qiqiang got up and took Tang Xiaohu to the corner of the bar with a low voice: " How is your brother?”
    “我去看他了，他在里面挺好的，叫你别担心。”
"I went to see him. He's fine in there. Don't worry.”
    “叫他好好表现，监狱的关系我都打点好了，搞几次减刑，很快就出来了。”
"Tell him to do well, I have done all the prison relations, made several commutations, and soon came out.”
    唐小虎笑着点头道：“谢谢强哥！”
Tang Xiaohu smiled and nodded: " Thank you strong brother!”
    沙发中央只剩下高启盛，他被姑娘们众星拱月般哄着，好不得意。醉眼蒙眬间，他起身走到麦克风前：“我说两句。”
 In the middle of the sofa was only Gao Qisheng, who was coaxed by the girls. In his drunken eyes, he got up and went to the microphone. " I say.”
    大家安静下来，都望着他。
Everyone was quiet and looked at him.
    “我，高启盛，今天生日！感谢谁？感谢父母！我是工人的孩子，白手起家，小本生意！做到今天，终于有点儿起色。感谢谁？”伸手一指高启强，“感谢我哥！”
"I, Gao Qisheng, today's birthday! Thank you who?thanks for parents! I am a worker's child, started from scratch, a small business! Do today, finally a little better. Thank you who?"Pointing to Gao Qiqiang," thank my brother!”
    众人叫好，高启强稳重地笑笑。
Everyone cheered, Gao Qiqiang steady smile.
    高启盛跺了跺脚：“这是什么地方？白金瀚！可能有些人不清楚，这个店以前不是我们高家的。它建起来的时候，我还在读书，我哥还在卖鱼！正所谓雕栏玉砌应犹在，只是朱颜改！不管白金瀚以前归谁，现在是我们高家的！在京海，高家看上的东西，早晚都是高家的！”
 Gao Qisheng stamped his foot. " What is this place? Platinum han! Maybe some people do not know, this shop was not our high family before. When it was built, I was still reading, and my brother was still selling fish! Is the so-called carved column jade build by laying bricks or stones should still be in, but Zhu Yan change! No matter who she used to be, now it is our high family! In Jinghai, gao jia see things, sooner or later are gao jia!”
    大伙欢呼起来！
Everyone cheered up!
    高启强眉头微皱，附在小虎耳边说：“小盛醉了，扶他下来休息。”
Gao Qiqiang frowned slightly, attached to the tiger ear said: " Xiao Sheng drunk, help him down to rest.”
    高启盛举杯：“姑娘们，敬我哥一杯！”
 Gao Qisheng raised a glass: " Girls, a toast to my brother!”
    姑娘们举着杯向高启强蜂拥而来，唐小虎挤在脂粉堆里压根出不去。
 The girls held a cup to Gao Ziqiang swarmed, Tang Xiaohu crowded in the powder pile can not go out.
    高启盛在台上哈哈大笑。
 Gao Qisheng laughed out loud on the stage.
    突然，包房门开了，屋里瞬间没人出声，气氛凉到了冰点。
Suddenly, the door opened, no one in the room, the atmosphere cool to the freezing point.
    唐小虎结巴着：“嫂子……”
Tang Xiaohu stammered: "Sister-in-law......"
    高启盛酒被吓醒了一大半，叫了声：“嫂子。”
 Gao Qisheng wine was scared and half awakened, and shouted: " Sister-in-law.”
    陈书婷没有任何表情。
 Chen Shuting did not have any expression.
    高启强开着车，陈书婷坐在副驾驶座上，斑驳的夜色从他们的脸上掠过。
 As Gao drove, Chen sat in the passenger seat, and the mottled night swept across their faces.
    高启强眼见陈书婷情绪缓和，长出了一口气，打了个酒嗝。
Gao Qiqiang saw Chen Shuting mood ease, long a sigh of relief, hit a wine hiccup.
    陈书婷说道：“以后喝了酒别开车，找个司机吧。”
Chen shuting said: " Don't drive after drinking alcohol, find a driver.”
    高启强笑道：“花那个钱干什么？”
Gao Ziqiang smiled and said, " Why spend that money?”
    “你又不缺那点儿钱。对了，泰叔明天要见你。”
"You don't lack that little money. By the way, Uncle Tai wants to see you tomorrow.”
    “老爷子找我干什么？”
"What did the Pops do by looking for with me?”
    “他没细说，但是不太高兴，你明天见他多赔笑脸。虽说建工集团的大权交给了你，但人马都是老爷子一手带出来的。”
"He didn't elaborate, but he was not very happy. You will see him smile more tomorrow. Although the power of the construction group is given to you, but the men are brought out by the man.”
    高启强点头说道：“我明白。”
 Gao Ziqiang nodded and said, " I understand.”
    京海建工集团董事长办公室里，茶水缓缓浇在金蟾茶宠上，茶宠的颜色变得鲜艳起来。
 In the office of the chairman of Jinghai Construction Engineering Group, the tea is slowly poured on the golden toad tea pet, and the color of the tea pet becomes bright.
    先前出狱的女囚程程，三十来岁的年纪，锋芒毕露，欲望都写在脸上。她从“211”大学毕业，为泰叔顶罪，坐了三年牢，重回建工集团，做了董事长助理。此时的她已换上干练的职业套装，推开门，带着高启强走进来。
The female prison Cheng Cheng, 3 old age, sharp, desire is written on the face. She graduated from the "211" university, for the Thai uncle blame, sat three years in prison, returned to the construction group, as the chairman assistant. At this time, she has changed into a capable professional suit, opened the door, with Gao Qiqiang came in.
    高启强笑着打了一声招呼：“泰爸。”
 Gao qiqiang smiled and said hello: " Tai dad.”
    泰叔专注地欣赏着茶宠的颜色变化，压根没瞥他一眼。
Uncle Tai intently appreciated the color change of the tea pet, without even taking a glance at him.
    片刻后，泰叔缓缓说道：“程程，这个大蛤蟆我不喜欢，换个别的。”
After a moment, Uncle Tai said slowly: " Cheng Cheng, I don't like this big toad, for another one.”
    程程微微一笑：“金蟾是招财的。”
Cheng Cheng smiled slightly: " The golden toad is a fortune.”
    泰叔指桑骂槐地说道：“你看它招来了吗？张着个大嘴只会呱呱大叫，一点儿真本事都没有。去给我换个牛啊马啊，踏实肯干的来。”
 Uncle Tai said and said: " Do you see it brought? With a big mouth will only quack, no real skill. To give me a cow and horse, willing to work.”
    高启强的脸抽搐了几下。
 Gao qiqiang's face convulsed several times.
    程程俯身要拿起茶宠。
Cheng Cheng bent over to pick up the tea pet.
    泰叔忽然一摆手：“先放着吧，我再看看。”
 Uncle Tai suddenly waved his hand: " Put it first, I will look.”
    “是。”程程识相地换水，重新沏茶。
"yes."Cheng Cheng wisely changed the water and made the tea again.
    泰叔这才抬眼望向高启强。“来了，坐！”
Uncle Tai then looked up to Gao Qiqiang."Here, sit down!”
    高启强依然笑着：“泰爸，最近身体挺好？”
Gao Qiqiang still smiled: " Tai dad, recently in good health?”
    泰叔摇摇头：“老样子，每天吃的药比米还多。你管着整个集团，心思不要花在我身上。我问你，莽村的项目怎么样了？”
Uncle Tai shook his head: " In the same way, I eat more medicine than rice every day. You control the whole group, don't spend it on me. I ask you, how is the project in Mang Village?”
    “很顺利，村支书李有田一听我们要投资建度假村，高兴得不得了。就他们村那几块破地，也只有我们才会开出那么好的条件。”
"It went well. Li Youtian, the village party secretary, was very happy when we heard that we wanted to invest in the resort. Their village that a few broken land, and only we will open so good conditions.”
    泰叔瞥了一眼高启强：“你还不知道？咱们想要的那块地已经开始动工了。”
Uncle Tai glanced at Gao Qiqiang: " You don't know? Construction has already begun on the land we want.”
    高启强急道：“什么？”
Gao Qiqiang urgent way: " What?”
    程程这时说道：“我打听过，负责施工的是李有田的儿子。”
Cheng Cheng then said, " I asked out that it was Li Youtian's son who was in charge of the construction.”
    高启强皱着眉：“但是他们拿不到区里的批文，干了也是白干……”
 Gao Qiqiang frowned: "But they can not get the approval of the district, dry is also white dry......"
    话刚说一半，高启强突然意识到真正的问题——莽村既然敢动工，就一定有把握拿到批文。区长龚开疆，未必真的站在自己这边。
Just said half of the words, Gao Qiqiang suddenly realized the real problem —— Mang village since dare to start construction, it must be sure to get the approval. District Mayor Gong Kaijiang, may not really stand on his own side.
    程程清清嗓子，说道：“其实这个计划，我从一开始就有些担心。要使用莽村的集体土地而不转变土地性质，就需要村委会出资占比一半以上，咱们必然受制于人。将来就算真的拿到拆迁补贴，也要被莽村分走一大半。”
Cheng Cheng cleared his throat and said, " Actually, I was worried about this plan from the very beginning. In order to use the collective land of Mang village without changing the nature of the land, the village committee needs to contribute more than half of the proportion, and we must be subject to others. In the future, even if you really get the demolition subsidy, it will be divided by the village.”
    泰叔自顾自地轻声道：“拾柴点火的都是建工集团，最后煮熟的鸭子让别人捞走了，买卖不能这么做吧？”
Uncle Tai said softly: " The firewood ignition is the construction group, the last cooked duck let others take away, the business can't do so?”
    高启强站起来，说：“我去处理。”
Gao Qiqiang stood up and said, " I'll deal with it.”
    泰叔拿起金蟾茶宠，递给高启强。“把这个带走。记住，光是叫得响可不行。”
 Uncle Tai picked up the golden toad tea pet and handed it to Gao Qiqiang."Take this one away. Remember, just be loud.”
    高启强阴着脸，走到自己的车旁。他掂了掂金蟾，用尽力气把它扔得远远的，仿佛出了口恶气，然后才钻进车里。
 Gao Ziqiang, looking overcast, walked over to his car. He weighed the golden toad, threw it far away, as if he were angry, and then got into the car.
    入夜时分，海鲜酒楼门口，高启强扶着衣冠不整的龚开疆走出餐厅大门。来到龚开疆的车旁，高启盛已经抱着两个纸箱，等在车后了。
At night, at the door of the seafood restaurant, Gao Kaiqiang helped the disheveled Gong Kaijiang out of the restaurant door. To Gong Kaijiang's car, Gao Qisheng was already holding two cardboard boxes, waiting behind the car.
    高启强指着箱子说道：“一点儿土特产，海米虾皮什么的。”
 Gao Ziqiang pointed to the box and said, " A little local specialty, sea rice shrimp skin.”
    司机打开汽车后备厢，然后懂事地钻进驾驶室。
 The driver opened the trunk of the car and got into the cab.
    龚开疆打开纸箱，在海米虾皮中划拉几把，用保鲜膜包好的成捆的人民币便露了出来。
Gong opened the carton, pulled it through the shrimp skin, and exposed the bundles of yuan wrapped in plastic wrap.
    龚开疆撇撇嘴，不满道：“高老板生意越做越大，出手倒是越来越小气了。”
Gong Kaijiang curled his mouth and said, " Boss Gao's business got bigger and bigger, but he became more and more stingy.”
    高启强说道：“本来还有两箱，但莽村的项目出了点儿问题，只好挪去那边救急了。”
Gao qiqiang said, " There were two boxes, but there was something going wrong with the project, so I had to move there for emergency.”
    龚开疆明白了，笑着摇摇头：“你说的这个事儿，我也是今天刚知道。而且要说生气，我比你更生气。因为他们用地的审批报告是从市里传下来的，已经有了领导的签字，到我这只是走个过场。”
Gong Kaijiang understood, and shook his head with a smile. " I just knew what you said today. And to say angry, I'm more angry than you. Because the approval report of their land was handed down from the city, and with the signature of the leaders, I just made a walk.”
    高启强皱眉：“市里……是哪位领导？”
Gao Qiqiang frowned: " the city... which is the leader?”
    龚开疆摇摇头：“这你不用知道。李有田这个老浑蛋，这次不光耍了你，也没给我留一口汤。”
Gong Kaijiang shook his head. " You don't need to know that. Li Youtian, an old muddy egg, not only played with you, but also did not leave me a mouthful of soup.”
    高启强稍一沉思，说：“明白了，莽村的事我自己处理。欠您的两箱土特产，改天送到家里去。”
 Gao Qiqiang pondered a little and said, " I understand, I deal with the matter of Mang village. Two boxes of local products owed to you will be sent home another day.”
    高启强把龚开疆扶上车，挥手告别。
Gao Qiqiang helped Gong Kaijiang into the car and waved goodbye.
    汽车开出老远，高启盛悄悄靠近高启强，说：“哥，他的话能信吗？”
The car left far away, Gao Qisheng quietly approached Gao Qiqiang, said: " Brother, can he believe his words?”
    高启强说道：“凭泰叔的关系，打听一下就知道真假，他没必要撒谎。”
Gao Qiqiang said: " With the relationship of Uncle uncle, inquire to know true or false, he does not need to lie.”
    高启盛皱眉：“那就这么算了？”
Gao Qisheng frowned: " That so forget it?”
    高启强恶狠狠地说道：“建工集团不能吃哑巴亏，李有田要放我的血，我就扒他的皮！”
 Gao Keqiang fiercely said ruthlessly: " the construction group can not eat dumb loss, Li Youtian to put my blood, I will pick his skin!”
    市公安局野外靶场上，64式手枪的零件被拆散，摊在桌子上。安欣戴着眼罩，迅速将枪组装完整。他一把扯下眼罩，左手持枪，向人形靶射击，一个弹夹的子弹瞬间打光。
 On the field range of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the parts of the Type 64 pistol were dismantled and spread out on the table. Wearing an eye mask, Anxin quickly assembled the gun together. He pulled off his blindfold, held a gun in his left hand, and fired at a human target, a bullet.
    李响站在他身后，冷冷看着他。
Li Xiang stood behind him and looked at him coldly.
    子弹打空了。李响走进靶场，摘下人形靶，看着上面的弹孔，问：“为什么要换左手？”
The bullet was empty. Li Xiang walked into the firing range, took off the humanoid target, looked at the bullet hole above, and asked, " Why do you want to change your left hand?”
    安欣说道：“特警左右手都能开枪，我也想练。我成绩怎么样？”
"The SWAT can shoot both left and right hands, and I want to practice. How are my grades doing?”
    李响把人形靶摊在安欣面前：“比右手还差，你怎么练都赶不上比武大赛了。”
 Li Xiang put the human target in front of Anxin: " It's worse than your right hand. You can't catch up with the competition.”
    安欣沮丧地将靶纸团成一团。
Ann sadly grouped the target paper together.

第四章　老默的鱼
 Chapter 4, Old Mo's Fish
    莽村的施工现场，脚手架的顶端，一个干瘦的老工人坐在架子上喝水。
 At the construction site of Mang village, at the top of the scaffolding, a thin old worker sits on the shelf drinking water.
    老默端着两个盒饭，走到他身边蹲下，将一份饭交给他。
Old Mo took two box lunches, came to him and squatted down, giving him a meal.
    “老李，凑合吃吧。”老默打开饭盒，“小工挣得少，都是我们这些外地人干，你一个莽村人，咋也跟我们干一样的？”
"Lao Li, make do with it."Old Mo opened the lunch box," small workers earn less, are we these outsiders do, you a mang village people, how also do the same with us?”
    老李叹口气：“莽村也不是家家都有钱，儿子身体不好，只能我出来干，跟有技术的比不了啊！早知道年轻时候学个泥瓦工也好。哎，你趁年轻学点儿技术，啥也不会，老了要吃亏。”
 Lao Li sighed: " Mang village is not every family is rich, the son body is not good, I can only come out to do, with the technology than ah! I would have known how to be a mason when I was young. Well, if you learn some skills while you are young, you will know nothing. You will suffer when you get old.”
    老默点头称是，把自己饭盒里的咸鱼都夹到了老李饭盒里的米饭上，老李感激地笑笑。
Lao Mo nodded and said yes, putting all the salted fish in his lunch box to the rice in Lao Li's lunch box. Lao Li smiled gratefully.
    工头在楼下吹响哨子：“快吃快吃，开工了！”
 The foreman blew the whistle downstairs: " Eat fast, eat fast, start work!”
    老李猛扒几口，吃光了盒饭，站了起来。
 Lao Li Meng took a few bites, ate up the box lunch, and stood up.
    老默退后一步，随手解开了老李挂在钢管上的安全绳扣。
Old Mo stepped back a step and untied the safety rope that old Li hung on the steel pipe.
    “老李，你的安全绳开了！”
"Lao Li, your safety rope is gone!”
    老李一愣，低头查看身上。
 Lao Li a leng, look down to check the body.
    老默趁他分神，突然猛推了他一把。老李惨叫一声，摔了下去。老默随后扬长而去。
 Old Mo, who had distracted him, suddenly thrust him hard. Lao Li cried out and fell down. Old Mo then left.
    现场乱成一团，所有人都往老李的尸体处聚拢。
 The scene was in chaos, and everyone gathered at Lao Li's body.
    村委会的办公室里，李有田和李宏伟刚接听完建委的电话，有人举报莽村工地上出了严重的安全事故，要求立即停工，等待检查。李有田阴鸷的脸抑制不住地抖动。
In the office of the village committee, Li Youtian and Li Hongwei had just answered the phone of the construction committee, and someone reported a serious safety accident on the construction site, and asked for immediate work stoppage and waiting for inspection. Li Youtian's sinister face shook uncontrollably.
    “我还没得到消息，建委倒先知道了。好啊，高启强，你想来阴的，我们就倒过来玩明的！”
"I haven't got the news yet, but the construction committee knows it first. Well, Gao Qiqiang, you want to Yin, we will play upside down!”
    碉楼工地现场已经被片区的派出所民警封锁，四周拉着警戒线，阻挡着围观的村民和工人。李响和安欣均在现场。就在李响让人调取监控寻找嫌疑人线索时，李有田在儿子的搀扶下出来，大声喊着：“杀人犯是高启强！”李有田和李宏伟一顿控诉，村里人被煽动得义愤填膺。
The Diaolou site has been blocked by the district police station police, around the cordon, blocking the villagers and workers. Li Xiang and An Xin were both at the scene. In Li Xiang let people transferred to monitor to find the suspect clues, Li Youtian in the son's help out, shouted: " the murderer is Gao Qiqiang!"Li Youtian and Li Hongwei complained, the villagers were stirred up to righteous indignation.
    李宏伟既像是说给警察听，又像是说给所有村民听，扯开嗓子大声道：“高启强看上了我们村的这块地，要抢！我们没答应，他就派人来给工程捣乱！”
Li Hongwei seemed to talk to the police and to all the villagers, saying loudly at the top of his voice, " Gao Qiqiang has a crush on this land in our village. I want to rob it! We didn't agree, so he sent someone to make trouble with the project!”
    李有田与儿子一唱一和，做痛心疾首状。“无非就是求财，何必要害命啊！早知道他这么狠，这块地送给他都行，别伤害村里的乡亲啊！”
Li Youtian and his son sing together, do distressed head."Nothing more than seeking money, why kill you! Had known he was so ruthless, this land to him, don't hurt the villagers!”
    李响轻声问一旁的安欣：“你怎么看？你了解高启强。”
Li Xiang softly asked Anxin side: " What do you think? You know Gao Qiqiang.”
    安欣想了想：“我觉得他能做得出来。”
Anxin thought for a while. " I think he can do it.”
    “这个案子交给你负责，行不行？”
"Can you leave you in charge of this case?”
    安欣冷笑：“碰到高启强，你就躲了？”
 An Xin sneer: " meet Gao Qiqiang, you hide?”
    李山突然出现在警戒线外，哭着想冲进现场，引起一阵骚乱。
Li Shan suddenly appeared outside the police cordon, crying to be rushed into the scene, causing a riot.
    李山看见李响，大喊起来：“儿子，死的是你老叔啊！小时候他还抱过你，你得替他报仇啊！”
When Li Shan saw Li Xiang, he shouted, " Son, it is your old uncle who dies! He hugged you when he was a child. You have to avenge him!”
    李响无比头疼地说道：“看到了吧，我不是躲高启强，是避嫌。”
 Li Xiang said with a headache: " See, I am not hiding from Gao Qiqiang, is to avoid suspicion.”
    安欣不知道是该嘲讽李响，还是该同情他。
 An Xin did not know whether to mock Li Xiang, or whether to sympathize with him.
    市局的接待室里，李有田和李宏伟还有其他村委会成员按辈分坐在屋里，完全把这里变成了村委会，正吵得不可开交。
In the reception room of the city bureau, Li Youtian and Li Hongwei and other members of the village committee sat in the house, completely changing it to the village committee.
    “早说了高启强不好惹，工程给他们做，咱们捡现成的不好吗？李顺他儿子来闹了，逼着要赔偿，宏伟是负责人，得给个说法。”
"Early said Gao Qiqiang is not easy to provoke, the project to do for them, we pick up ready-made is not good? Li Shun his son came to make trouble, forced to compensate, Hongwei is the person in charge, have to give a statement.”
    李宏伟眼珠子一瞪，要急眼，被李有田瞪了一眼，只好把头埋下。
Li Hongwei eyes a stare, to urgent eyes, was Li Youtian stare one eye, had to bury his head.
    “支书，这工程还干不干了？你得拍个板啊！”
"Party secretary, this project is still done? You have to take a board!”
    李有田又像蔫了似的，眯着眼睛，嘬着烟头，任由他们吵闹。
 Li Youtian again like withered, squinting eyes, sucking cigarette butts, let them make noise.
    李响和安欣推门进来，所有人站了起来。
Li Xiang and An Xin pushed the door and came in. Everyone stood up.
    安欣问道：“笔录都做完了？”
Anxin asked, " Are all the transcripts done?”
    李有田点头：“做完了。”
Li Youtian nodded: " That's done.”
    安欣拉开椅子，说：“咱们再聊聊。”
Anxin pulled open her chair and said, " Let's talk again.”
    李有田一脸无奈：“该说的我们都说了，现场你们都看了，死者家里也去了，还要聊什么？”
Li Youtian a face helpless: " the say we all said, you all saw the scene, the dead home also went, but also to talk about what?”
    “再多听听，总会有新的收获。”
"Listen again more, and there is always something new.”
    李有田皱眉：“也就是说，你们现在的线索不够抓高启强呗？”
 Li Youtian frowned: " That is to say, your current clue is not enough to catch Gao Keqiang bai?”
    老头说得如此露骨，安欣和李响只好尴尬地笑笑。
The old man said so explicit, An Xin and Li Xiang had to smile awkwardly.
    李有田在人群里扫了一圈，突然大惊小怪道：“哎，李山哥怎么没来？这么大的事儿，得把李山哥叫来！”
Li Youtian swept a circle in the crowd, suddenly made a fuss said: " Ah, why did Li Shan brother not come? Such a big thing, we have to call Brother Li Shan!”
    李响皱皱眉：“不用了，李山没参与这个项目，知道的消息大多是道听途说。”
Li Xiang frowned: " No, Li Shan did not participate in this project, know most of the news is hearsay.”
    李有田诚恳说道：“话不能这么说，村里一直很重视你爸的意见。以前分地办厂的时候，有很多困难，对你们家照顾不周，这么多年我一直过意不去。现在日子越来越好，是该给你们家补贴补贴了。”
 Li Youtian sincerely said: " I can't say so, the village always attaches great importance to your father's opinion. In the past, when setting up a factory, there were many difficulties, and I did not take good care of your family. I have been feeling sorry for so many years. Now that life is getting better and better, it's time to subsidize your family.”
    李响听不下去了，向安欣使眼色。
Li Xiang could not listen, and stared at Anxin.
    安欣说道：“老支书，我们时间紧迫，还是先聊正经事。”
An Xin said: " Old party secretary, we are short of time, or talk about serious things first.”
    李有田点头道：“正经事？好！你们把知道的都说出来！”
 Li Youtian nodded and said, " Serious matter?good! Say everything you know!”
    莽村的人一拥而上，围着两个警察七嘴八舌，开始咒骂起高启强来。
 The people of Mang village, around the two police, began to curse Gao Qiqiang.
    市局刑警队会议室里，所有人围坐在一起，局长郭文杰列席，正在听李响介绍案情。
City bureau criminal police conference room, all people sitting together, director Guo Wenjie attended, is listening to Li Xiang introduced the case.
    “根据目前掌握的情况，这可能是一起经济纠纷引发的刑事案件，现成立专案组。由于涉案一方在莽村，是我本人的户籍所在地，我申请避嫌。专案组由安欣同志任组长，全权负责。安欣，下面你来说。”
"According to the current situation, this may be a criminal case caused by an economic dispute, and a task force is now set up. Since the party involved was in Mang Village, where my household registration was located, I applied to avoid suspicion. The task force is headed by Comrade An Xin and is in full charge. Anxin, here.”
    安欣起身说：“据莽村反映的线索，京海建工集团的高启强有很大的嫌疑。”安欣将高启强的照片、资料贴在白板上，“高启强2001年正式入职京海建工集团，担任项目经理，为建工集团拿下了不少大项目，帮助建工集团发展壮大，使其成为本市最大的建筑承包公司。他于2004年升任总经理，地位仅次于董事长陈泰。据传闻，高启强私下称呼陈泰为爸爸，是公认的集团继承人。在高启强任职期间，我们收到多起报案，声称高启强使用暴力手段，打击竞争对手，压低价格，垄断市场。但这些案件要么缺少证据，要么受害人私下和解，我们始终没有抓到高启强的把柄。”安欣将更多高启强爪牙的照片贴在白板上。“这些人是高启强身边的骨干力量，大多数来自旧厂街，很早就认识高启强。除了唐小龙正在监狱服刑，其他人都逍遥法外。”
An Xin stood up and said: " According to the clues reflected by Mang Cun, Gao Qiqiang of Jinghai Construction Engineering Group is very suspected."An Xin posted Gao Qiqiang's photos and materials on the whiteboard." Gao Qiqiang officially joined Jinghai Construction Engineering Group in 2001 as the project manager. He won many large projects for the construction engineering Group, helped the group develop and grow, and made it the largest construction contracting company in the city. He was promoted to general manager in 2004, second only to chairman Chen Tai. According to rumors, Gao Qiqiang privately called Chen Tai as his father, is recognized as the heir of the group. During Gao's tenure, we received several reports claiming that Gao had used violent means to attack competitors, lower prices and monopolize the market. But these cases either lack of evidence, or the victims privately settled, we have never caught Gao Qiqiang handle."Anxin posted more photos of Gao Qi Qiang's claws on the whiteboard."These people are the backbone of Gao Qiqiang. Most of them come from Guchang Street and have known Gao for a long time. Except for Tang Xiaolong, who is in prison, everyone else is at large.”
    郭文杰咳嗽了一声，说：“注意一下措辞，只有有确凿的证据能证明他们犯了罪，才能说他们是逍遥法外。”
Guo Wenjie coughed and said, " Pay attention to the wording. Only with solid evidence that they have committed a crime can they are at large.”
    “高启强今非昔比，以他现在的身份，调查起来阻力会很大。”安欣说道，“以我对他的了解，他不会让这些案子与他有任何牵连，所以找他也是白费工夫。”
"Gao Qiqiang is not what he used to be, there will be great resistance to investigate."Said Anxin." With what I know about him, he won't let these cases get involved in him, so he wasted his time.”
    郭文杰看着安欣，说：“说说你的办法。”
 Guo Wenjie looked at Anxin and said, " Tell me about your way.”
    安欣拿起另一个文件夹，递给郭文杰，里面是老默的画像和假身份证的复印件。
Anxin picked up another folder and handed it to Guo, a portrait of Mo and a copy of his fake ID card.
    “这是目击证人描述的嫌疑人画像，他使用的假身份证很新，应该刚做不久。去年，我市集中打击了一批办假证的窝点，相关信息应该可以利用。”
"This is a portrait of the suspect described by the eyewitness. The fake ID card he used is very new and should have been done soon. Last year, the city concentrated on cracking down on a number of fake card dens, the relevant information should be used.”
    郭文杰想了想，问：“抓到办假证的，顺藤摸瓜查到凶手？”
Guo Wenjie thought, asked: " caught a false card, follow the trail to find the murderer?”
    “是。”
"yes.”
    郭文杰说道：“嗯，这个思路倒是可行，那高启强那边该怎么办？莽村的人一直揪着他不放。”
Guo Wenjie said: " Well, this idea is feasible, that Gao Ziqiang there how to do? The people of Mang village have been holding him on.”
    安欣摇头道：“没有证据表明凶手跟高启强有关，找他也是白找。如果真是他指使的，那他肯定做好了被传唤的准备。所以我们先不去理他，等高启强自己出牌。”
 Anxin shook his head and said, " There is no evidence that the murderer is related to Gao Qiqiang. Look for him for nothing. If it is really at his order, then he must be ready to be summoned. So we do not go to him, wait for Gao Qiqiang his own card.”
    白金瀚的办公室里，房间布局与之前徐江在时差别很大，暴发户的气质少了很多，多了几个大书柜，里面放着各种名著、工商管理相关的书籍等。但仔细看，这些书绝大多数都是崭新的，还没开封。高启强坐在宽大的老板椅上，望着电话发呆。
In the office of Platinum Han, the layout of the room is very different from that of Xu Jiang before. The temperament of the nouveau riche is much less, with a few large bookcases, which put a variety of famous books and books related to industry and business administration. But on closer look, most of these books are brand new and unopened. Gao Qiqiang sat in the wide boss's chair, staring at the phone.
    高启盛推门进来，叫了一声：“哥！”
Gao Qisheng pushed the door and came in, and called out: " Brother!”
    高启强似乎吓了一跳：“大白天的不去看店，跑我这里干什么？”
Gao Qiqiang seems to be surprised: " During the daytime not to see the shop, run me here why?”
    “十几个连锁店，我哪儿看得过来？你还以为是当年那个破门头啊？”
"How can I see them? You thought it was the head?”
    “糊涂了，钱来得太快，脑子还没跟上。莽村停工几天了？”
"Mudused, the money comes so fast, the brain has not caught up. How many days has Mang village been suspended?”
    高启盛想了想，说：“四天了吧，我给建委、土地局、安监办都打了电话，让他们轮番去查。李宏伟的草台班子没有资质，证都是借的，被罚了不少。”
Gao Qisheng thought about it and said: " Four days later, I called the construction committee, the land bureau and the safety supervision office, asking them to take turns to check. Li Hongwei's grass tai team is not qualified, the certificate is borrowed, was punished a lot.”
    “都四天了，公安怎么还不联系我？”
"It's been four days. Why didn't the police contact me?”
    高启盛笑着说：“青华区派出所办不了，上交给市局了。”
Gao Qisheng said with a smile: " Qinghua District police station can not do, on to the city bureau.”
    “市局，是不是又落到安欣手里了？”
"City bureau, is it falling into the hands of Anxin again?”
    “肯定啊，这几年他像块狗皮膏药一样，甩都甩不掉，这案子他肯交给别人办？”
"Sure, these years he like a dog skin plaster, throw off, this case he is willing to give others to do?”
    “他什么时候变得这么沉得住气了？不管他，把话放出去，谁敢接莽村的工程，就是跟建工集团过不去。”
"When did he become so calm? No matter he, put the words out, who dare to accept the project of the village, is with the construction group.”
    “放心，现在根本没有建筑队敢接他们的活儿。”
"Rest assured, no construction team dares to take their work right now.”
    “只要逼得李有田认输，剩下的无非就是赔钱私了，安欣查也查不出什么。”
"As long as forced Li Youtian to throw in the towel, the rest is nothing more than to lose money private, Anxin check also can not find out what.”
    高启盛笑道：“明白。”
 Gao Qisheng smiled and said, " Understand.”
    城市边缘，高高低低的旧楼中藏着各种手工作坊。街道上，几名工人正在加装交通摄像头。安欣和年轻的陆寒窝在一辆破旧的面包车里，打量着整个街区。安欣拿着犯罪嫌疑人的画像，冥思苦想。
On the edge of the city, there are various handicraft workshops. On the street, several workers are installing traffic cameras. Anxin and young Lu were in a shabby van, surveying the block. Anxin took the portrait of the suspect and thought hard.
    陆寒探头瞅瞅：“一直盯着，有那么好看吗？”
Lu Han probe Chou Chou Chou: " keep staring at, have so good-looking?”
    “总觉得眼熟。”
"Always feel something familiar to the eye.”
    陆寒随口说道：“会不会是通缉犯？”
Lu Han casually said: " Will it be a wanted man?”
    “通缉犯的照片天天瞅，一眼就认得出来。这人不是，我只是想不起来在哪儿见过。”
"I look at the pictures of a wanted man every day, and I can recognize them at a glance. This guy is not, I just can't remember where I saw it anywhere.”
    陆寒拍拍安欣，指向车外：“来了！”
 Lu Han patted An Xin, pointed outside the car: " Here!”
    一个年轻人趿拉着鞋，蓬头垢面，一副没睡醒的样子，走到一家破门店前，开锁进去。
A young man, in his shoes and unkempt, went to a broken store and opened the lock.
    安欣说道：“走！”
 Anxin said, " Go!”
    年轻人便是打着“打字复印”的旗号办假证的人。安欣和陆寒一顿吓唬，对方便招了，但是一天卖出去几百张假身份证，根本记不住画像上的人。安欣只好让对方记住画像，有消息马上联络自己，同时在打印店外装好了监控摄像头。
Young people are those who get fake certificates under the banner of "typing and photocopying". An Xin and Lu Han threatened them, but sold hundreds of fake ID cards a day, simply can not remember the people on the portrait. Anxin had to let the other side remember the portrait, the news immediately contacted himself, at the same time installed the surveillance camera outside the printing store.
